# hka-info-labs
or aka: "A hacker's guide to HKA"

This repo contains some useful resources for setting up alternative dev environments for the computer science laboratories at hka.
This repo does **not** contain solutions for the labs.

These setups should be *hacker* friendly by being:
* IDE independent
* cli friendly
* open source

Contributions are welcome, just open a PR!
